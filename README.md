I take no responsibility for any harm caused by this script including injured cats or nuclear hollocaust. Use it at your own risk. In fact you really should only use this if you understand it because you need to know a little bash to configure conditions for when to send to webhooks. This is released under a custom license im calling the NOSUPPORT license Basically, do whatever you want with it, just dont ask me to support it! Sorry, I didn't figure out an easy way to abstract the config so normal non unix admin users could configure it. I just wrote it as a quick solution for myself, but I figured why not share with you guys too. Oh and FYI the bot will leak your mapquest key... the only way around that would be to download the image and then attach it to every post.
